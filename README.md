# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Use this work day scheduler to type appointments and To-Do's into the hours of the work day between  9 am and 6 pm. Type your appointments and click the save button on the right side of the corresponding hour, allowing the user to refresh or leave the scheduler webpage and return to it later with the scheduled items still viewable. The colors of each hour's space will change color accoring to the current time of the day. If the hour's event is in the future, the hour will be green.
